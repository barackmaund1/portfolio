                        <h3>My is Barack maundu</h3>
                        <p>I reside at kibera Nairobi.I am highly passinate in learning tech and i joined moringa school of software development to market aligned skills. </p>
                        <p>I am highly organized. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I’m always able to find what I need. I find this increases efficiency and helps the rest of the team stay on track, too. In my last role, I created a new filing process that increased departmental efficiency 25%</p>
                        <p>I’m a people-person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. I find this skill is especially helpful when kicking off projects with new clients. In my previous job, my clients’ customer satisfaction scores were 15% over the company average</p>
